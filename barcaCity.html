    Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ BAR-sə-LOH-nə, Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə], Spanish:
    [baɾθeˈlona]) is a city on the coast of northeastern Spain. It is the
    capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well
    as the second most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6
    million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous
    neighbouring municipalities within the Province of Barcelona and is home to
    around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area
    in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid, and Milan.[3] It
    is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the
    coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to
    the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of
    which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high. Founded as a Roman city, in the
    Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After
    joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of
    Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of
    Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the
    main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken
    by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before
    the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in
    1492. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important
    cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are
    the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which
    have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of
    the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and
    Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean
    are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer
    Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions and also many
    international sport tournaments. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic,
    and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[8] as well as the main biotech
    hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global
    socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[10]
