    The history of Barcelona stretches over 2000 years to its origins as an
    Iberian village named Barkeno.[1] Its easily defensible location on the
    coastal plain between the Collserola ridge (512 m) and the Mediterranean
    Sea, the coastal route between central Europe and the rest of the Iberian
    peninsula, has ensured its continued importance, if not always preeminence,
    throughout the ages. Barcelona is currently a city of 1,620,943,[2] the
    second largest in Spain, and the capital of the autonomous community of
    Catalonia. Its wider urban region is home to three-quarters of the
    population of Catalonia and one-eighth of that of Spain.

        Futbol Club Barcelona is a Spanish professional football club based in
        Barcelona. The club first participated in a European competition in
        1910, and from 1955 onwards spent every season in one or more European
        competitions. The first international cup they took part in was the
        Pyrenees Cup. The competition lasted from 1910 to 1914 and Barcelona won
        four out of five editions. From 1914 to the beginning of the Latin Cup
        in 1949, Barcelona did not participate in any international
        competitions. From the 1955–56 season, with the exception of the 1956–57
        (during the first Fairs Cup, because a Vienna XI withdrew from the
        competition), they are the only team to have played in the European cups
        every year until today. Barcelona has won the now defunct UEFA Cup
        Winners' Cup four times and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup three times,
        which is more than any other club for both trophies.[1][2] They also
        took part in the Latin Cup twice as champions of Spain, winning on both
        occasions, a record shared with Real Madrid and Milan. Though they did
        not manage to win the European Cup, now the UEFA Champions League,
        during the early years of the competition, they have since won the
        trophy five times, with their first win in 1992.[3] Barcelona have moved
        to the second place of the ranking of Europe's most successful clubs in
        terms of international trophies won, just behind Real Madrid. In the
        second part of 2015, with the UEFA Super Cup victory in Tbilisi against
        Sevilla and the FIFA Club World Cup victory in Yokohama against River
        Plate meant the Catalans have won 20 different titles, behind Real
        Madrid's 26. In the tables, "(H)" denotes home ground, "(A)" denotes
        away ground and "(N)" symbolises neutral ground. The first score is
        always Barcelona's.
