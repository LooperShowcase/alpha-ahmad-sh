      <h2>Vital week</h2>
      Barcelona have two games that will condition the immediate future in both
      LaLiga Santander and the Europa League. On paper, Barcelona should still
      be stronger than their Turkish opponents in the return leg, however there
      are a number of factors which could make that a tricky proposition.
      Firstly, the infamous partisan support of the Istanbul club will make for
      a truly testing atmosphere, whilst the scheduling of the Clasico just
      three days later could force Xavi to play younger players in the bear-pit
      that is the Arena Seyrantepe.

      <h2>ronald oraujo</h2>
      Ronald Araujo is one of Barcelona's most important defensive players at
      the moment, but the club are fearful of what could lie ahead in his
      contract renewal talks. Barcelona are not ruling anything out, and they
      won't be shocked by any unwanted surprises that present themselves. Joan
      Laporta wants Araujo to stay, but he made it clear that the club are more
      important than any one player and any offers will have to be considered
      should they come. Contact between Barcelona and the 23-year-old's camp has
      been made, and they are in negotiations. The Blaugrana see Araujo as an
      important part of their future, despite his contract running out in 2023.
      Premier League clubs Chelsea and Manchester United are just two to have
      been keeping a close eye on the Uruguayan's situation.
